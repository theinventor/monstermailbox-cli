# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added CLI-side owner email preflight for `mmb auth login` and `mmb register`.
  The CLI now rejects obvious placeholder/reserved domains and no-reply-style
  owner mailboxes before any registration request, so agents do not create
  inboxes or API keys with a mistaken non-human owner address.
- Added `mmb contact support` for first-class technical support questions from
  the CLI. It posts `{text, subject}` to the authenticated `/contact_support`
  API so support email routing stays server-side, emits JSON, supports stdin or
  explicit text, and honors shared mutation safety flags.
- Added `mmb contact product-feedback` as the clearer product-feedback command,
  while keeping `mmb agent-product-feedback` as a deprecated compatibility
  alias. This separates product feedback from local `mmb feedback` CLI notes
  without logging or documenting secrets.
